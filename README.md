# odin-etch-a-sketch

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).
It is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.
The drawing board is a square grid of div cells.
When the mouse enters a cell, its background color changes, leaving a pixelated trail through the grid like a pen would.
